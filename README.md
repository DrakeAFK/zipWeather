# zipWeather - A simple weather app

This is a simple weather app that uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to get weather data.  
It is written in vanilla JavaScript with no dependencies.  
Feel free to use this code as you wish to practice working with APIs.  
For security reasons, the API key is not included in this repository but you can get your own for free at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).
